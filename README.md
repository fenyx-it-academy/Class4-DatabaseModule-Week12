# Class4-DatabaseModule-Week13

Add and implement a MongoDB connection to either your Youtube Video Downloader App (assignment of 4th week) or your Python Module Project App. 
#### Used the banking app.

Use MongoDB Atlas as your cloud database and with the help of PyMongo, connect to the database and perform at least two of the CRUD operations.

#### Updated Save ans Load methods to save the user to the cloud and load from the cloud. The static method UserExists is also updated to check the cloud with the users name.

You can ignore the authentication, security etc. for now. Just perform two different types of simple CRUD operations.
#### Yeap, ignored all.
